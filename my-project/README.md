# Design and Develop

In the **Design and Develop** repository, I create random design concepts and then, over time, convert them into code. It's a space where I experiment with different UI ideas and turn them into functional components, all while improving my design and development skills. Feel free to explore and see how these concepts evolve!

## Project Structure

- **/src**: Contains the components that I develop based on random design concepts.
- **/src/assets**: Any images, icons, or other assets used within the components.
- **/public**: Public assets and the base HTML template.

## Getting Started

To get started with the development environment, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Neelothpal/design-and-develop.git
   cd design-and-develop
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:

   Install the necessary dependencies by running:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the development server**:

   After installing the dependencies, start the development server with:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   This will launch the development server, and you can see the components in action.

## Folder Structure

- `/src/components`: Contains the developed components based on random design concepts.
- `/src/assets`: Contains any static assets like images, icons, etc., used by components.

Feel free to explore and see how these concepts evolve!
